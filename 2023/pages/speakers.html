<h3><a id="uri"></a> Uri Shalit</h3>
<!-- <p>The year 2020 has brought into focus a second pandemic of social injustice and systemic bias with the disproportionate deaths observed for minority patients infected with COVID. As we observe an increase in development and adoption of AI for medical care, we note variable performance of the models when tested on previously unseen datasets, and also bias when the outcome proxies such as healthcare costs are utilized. Despite progressive maturity in AI development with increased availability of large open source datasets and regulatory guidelines, operationalizing fairness is difficult and remains largely unexplored. In this talk, we review the background/context for FAIR and UNFAIR sequelae of AI algorithms in healthcare, describe practical approaches to FAIR Medical AI, and issue a grand challenge with open/unanswered questions. </p> -->
<p> Uri Shalit is a senior lecturer (assistant professor) at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management, in the areas of statistics and information systems.
Uri's research is currently focused on three subjects:
The first is applying machine learning to the field of healthcare, especially in terms of providing physicians with decision support tools based on big health data. In this capacity he has worked with Clalit Health Services, Rambam Medical Center, and the Israeli Ministry of Health.
The second subject is the intersection of machine learning and causal inference, especially the problem of learning individual-level causal effects.
Finally, is interested in bringing ideas from causal inference into the field of machine learning, focusing on problems in robust learning, transfer learning and interpretability.</p>
<p> Previously, Uri was a postdoctoral researcher in Prof. David Sontag’s Clinical Machine Learning Lab in NYU and then MIT. He completed his PhD studies at the Center for Neural Computation at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, under the guidance of Prof. Gal Chechik and Prof. Daphna Weinshall. From 2011 to 2014 he was a recipient of Google's European Fellowship in Machine Learning. </p>

<!-- <p>Recent advances in training deep learning algorithms have demonstrated potential to accommodate the complex variations present in medical data. In this talk, I will describe technical advancements and challenges in the development and clinical application of deep learning algorithms designed to interpret medical images. I will also describe advances and current challenges in the deployment of medical imaging deep learning algorithms into practice. This talk presents work that is jointly done with Matt Lungren, Curt Langlotz, Nigam Shah, and several more collaborators.</p> -->
<p> Shalmali Joshi is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Research on Computation and Society at Harvard University. Previously, she was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Vector Institute. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin). Shalmali's research expertise is on developing reliable Machine Learning (ML) methods for clinical healthcare. She has contributed to ML research in explainability, algorithmic recourse, probabilistic modeling and causal inference for clinical decision-making.  She has also contributed to interdisciplinary venues on ethical challenges of deploying ML tools in clinical healthcare.</p>
    
<h3><a id="sendhil"></a> Sendhil Mullainathan</h3>
<!-- <p>Health disparities in the United States are one of the largest factors in reducing the health of the population. Disparities means some groups have lower life expectancy, are dying at higher rates from COVID-19, and utilize less mental health services, to name just a few examples. The future of medicine will be based on Artificial Intelligence and new technological platforms that promise to improve outcomes and reduce cost. Our role as AI researchers should be to ensure that these new technologies also reduce health disparities. In this talk I will describe recent work showing how we can work to reduce health disparities in the future of medicine. By ensuring that our task, datasets, algorithms and evaluations are equitable and representative of all types of patients, we can ensure that the research we develop will reduce health disparities.</p> -->
<p> Sendhil Mullainathan is the Roman Family University Professor of Computation and Behavioral Science at Chicago Booth. His latest research is on computational medicine—applying machine learning and other data science tools to produce biomedical insights.  In past work he has combined insights from behavioral science with empirical methods—experiments, causal inference tools, and machine learning—to study social problems such as discrimination and poverty. He currently teaches a course on Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p> Outside of research, he co-founded a non-profit to apply behavioral science (<a href="http://www.ideas42.org/">ideas42</a>), a center to promote the use of randomized control trials in development (the <a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/">Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab</a>), has worked in government in various roles, and currently serves on the board of the MacArthur Foundation board. He is also a regular contributor to the New York Times. </p>
