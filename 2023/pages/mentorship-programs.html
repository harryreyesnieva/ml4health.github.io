      <h1>Program Closed</h1>

  <div class="content">
<p> The purpose of the reviewer mentorship program is to train junior reviewers, foster new connections and relationships in the ML4H community, and ultimately improve the quality of the review process. The primary expectations of the program are that (1) mentors will provide feedback to mentees on drafts of their reviews and (2) mentees will update their reviews on the basis of that feedback. </p>
    
<p> If you are interested in participating in the reviewer mentorship program as a mentor/mentee please sign up using the following <a href="https://forms.gle/YvDVfhFa1CSTGxVr8">form</a> </p>

    <p> <b> Deadline: </b> September 10th AoE, 2021. </p>

     <li> Share drafts of their reviews with the mentors at least one week prior to the end of the review period (by September 29) so that there is time for revision following discussion with their mentor.  </li>
     <li> Meet with their mentor over a video/phone call to discuss the papers and receive feedback on their reviews. </li>
     <li> Submit your review to HotCRP by October 6, to allow the authors to provide responses to your review. </li>

    </ol>
  </p>

<h3>
  Structuring the feedback session
</h3>
<p> Mentors are free to structure the feedback session in whichever way they prefer. It is expected that mentors will read their mentees assigned papers and reviews and formulate their feedback prior to the feedback session with their mentee. However, the role of the mentor is not to serve as an additional reviewer on their mentee’s papers. Rather, the mentor should provide feedback to ensure that reviews are high-quality, constructive, and fair. To help facilitate that process, resources on what constitutes a high-quality review have been provided below. </p>
