<h1>ML4H Code of Conduct<sup>[1]</sup></h1>
<p>We, the participants involved with Machine Learning for Healthcare (ML4H), come together for the open exchange of ideas, the freedom of thought and expression, and for respectful scientific debate which is central to the goals of this Symposium. This requires a community and an environment that recognizes and respects the inherent worth of every person.</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSIBILITY</strong></p>
<p>All participants, organizers, reviewers, speakers, media, sponsors, and volunteers (referred to as “Participants” collectively throughout this document) at our Symposium and Symposium-sponsored social events are required to agree with this Code of Conduct both during an event and on official communication channels, including social media.</p>
<p>Sponsors are equally subject to this Code of Conduct. In particular, sponsors should not use images, activities, or other materials that are of a sexual, racial, or otherwise offensive nature. This code applies both to official sponsors as well as any organization that uses the Symposium name as branding as part of its activities at or around the Symposium.</p>
<p>Organizers will enforce this Code, and it is expected that all Participants will cooperate to help ensure a safe and inclusive environment for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>POLICY</strong></p>
<p>The symposium commits itself to providing an experience for all Participants that is free from the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harassment, bullying, and discrimination which includes but is not limited to:<ul>
<li>Offensive comments related to age, race, religion, creed, color, gender (including transgender/gender identity/gender expression), sexual orientation, medical condition, physical or intellectual disability, pregnancy, or medical conditions, national origin or ancestry.</li>
<li>intimidation, personal attacks, harassment, unnecessary disruption of talks or other symposium events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inappropriate or unprofessional behavior that interferes with another's full participation including:<ul>
<li>sexual harassment, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome attention, public vulgar exchanges, derogatory name-calling, and diminutive characterizations.</li>
<li>Use of images, activities, or other materials that are of a sexual, racial, or otherwise offensive nature that may create an inappropriate or toxic environment.</li>
<li>Disorderly, boisterous, or disruptive conduct including fighting, coercion, theft, damage to property, or any mistreatment or non-businesslike behavior towards participants.</li>
<li>Zoom bombing or any virtual activity that is not related to the topic of discussion which detracts from the topic or the purpose of the program. This includes inappropriate remarks in chat areas as deemed inappropriate by presenters/monitors/event leaders.</li>
<li>Individuals and organizations that make false claims or accusations related to ML4H business or inappropriately make comments online as if they represent ML4H without advanced approval.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scientific misconduct including fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism of paper submissions or research presentations, including demos, exhibits or posters.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies to the actual meeting sites and symposium venues where ML4H business is being conducted, including physical, virtual venues, and official virtual engagement platforms, including video, virtual streaming, and chat-based interactions. ML4H is not responsible for non-sponsored activity or behavior that may occur at non-sponsored locations such as hotels, restaurants, physical, virtual, or other locations not otherwise deemed a sanctioned space for ML4H sponsored events. Nonetheless, any issues brought to the Symposium organizers will be considered. However, it is also the case that ML4H cannot actively monitor voluntary social media platforms and cannot follow-up on every transaction occurring between individuals who voluntarily engage in argument and altercation outside the ML4H sponsored events virtual or otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>ACTION</strong></p>
<p>If a Participant engages in any inappropriate behavior as defined herein, the Symposium organizers may take action as deemed appropriate, including: a formal or informal warning to the offender, expulsion from the symposium with no refund, barring from participation in future symposiums or their organization, reporting the incident to the offender’s local institution or funding agencies, or reporting the incident to local authorities or law enforcement. A response of "just joking" is not acceptable. If action is taken, an appeals process will be made available. There will be no retaliation against any Participant who brings a complaint or submits an incident report in good faith or who honestly assists in investigating such a complaint. All issues brought forth to the onsite Symposium organizers during the course of a Symposium will be immediately investigated.</p>
<p><strong>COMPLAINT REPORTING</strong></p>
<p>The Symposium encourages all Participants to immediately report any incidents of discrimination, harassment, unprofessional conduct, and/or retaliation so that complaints can be quickly and fairly resolved. All complaints will be handled as confidentially as possible and information will be disclosed only as it is necessary to complete the investigation and bring to resolution. There will be no retaliation against any Participant who brings a complaint or submits an incident report in good faith or who honestly assists in investigating such a complaint. All issues brought forth to the Symposium Organizers during the course of a Symposium will be immediately investigated.</p>
<p>If you have concerns related to your participation/interaction at the Symposium or Symposium sanctioned events, or observe someone else's difficulties, or have any other concerns you wish to share, please contact the organizers at ml4h.2021@gmail.com. Complaints and violations will be researched and investigated as appropriate. Reports made during the Symposium will be responded to within 24 hours; those at other times in less than two weeks. We are prepared and eager to help Participants contact relevant help services, to escort them to a safe location, or to otherwise assist those experiencing harassment of any sort to feel safe for the duration of the Symposium.</p>
<hr />
<p>[1] This Code of Conduct is largely identical to the NeurIPS Code of Conduct. </p>
<p>[2] specifically, the following list covers in more detail features of behavior that could be subject to prejudice, harassment or discrimination: physical, cultural, or linguistic characteristics associated with a national origin group; marriage to or association with persons of a national origin group; tribal affiliation; membership in or association with an organization identified with or seeking to promote the interests of a national origin group; attendance or participation in schools, churches, temples, mosques, or other religious institutions generally used by persons of national origin group; and any name that is associated with a national origin group, genotype, marital status or registered domestic partner status. Other examples include: breastfeeding, military or veteran status, politics, technology choices, and age.</p>
