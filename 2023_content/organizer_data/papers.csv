Proceedings,8,Trust Issues - Uncertainty Estimation Does not Enable Reliable OOD Prediction On Medical Tabular Data,"Dennis Ulmer, Lotta Meijerink, Giovanni Cinà","Pacmed BV, Pacmed BV, Pacmed BV",1,1,Morning,"When deploying machine learning models in high-stakes real-world environments such as health care, it is crucial to accurately assess the uncertainty concerning a model's prediction on abnormal inputs. However, there is a scarcity of literature analyzing this problem on medical data, especially on mixed-type tabular data such as Electronic Health Records. We close this gap by presenting a series of tests including a large variety of contemporary uncertainty estimation techniques, in order to determine whether they are able to identify out-of-distribution (OOD) patients. In contrast to previous work, we design tests on realistic and clinically relevant OOD groups, and run experiments on real-world medical data. We find that almost all techniques fail to achieve convincing results, partly disagreeing with earlier findings.

Proceedings,20,sEMG Gesture Recognition with a Simple Model of Attention,"David Josephs*, Carson Drake*, Andrew Heroy, John Santerre","Southern Methodist University,Southern Methodist University,Southern Methodist University,Southern Methodist University",3,48,Afternoon,"                                 Myoelectric control is one of the leading areas of research in the field of robotic prosthetics. We present our
                                 research in surface electromyography (sEMG) signal classification, where our simple and novel attention-based approach now leads the industry, universally beating more complex, state-of-the-art models. Our novel attention-based model achieves benchmark leading results on multiple industry-standard datasets including 53 finger, wrist, and grasping motions, improving over both sophisticated signal processing and CNN-based approaches. Our strong results with a straightforward model also indicate that sEMG represents a promising avenue for future machine learning research, with applications not only in prosthetics, but also in other important areas, such as diagnosis and prognostication of neurodegenerative diseases, computationally mediated surgeries, and advanced robotic control. We reinforce this suggestion with extensive ablative studies, demonstrating that a neural network can easily extract higher order spatiotemporal features from noisy sEMG data collected by affordable, consumer-grade sensors.

Weiss, Pradeep Ravikumar","Carnegie Mellon University, University of California Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon University, Carnegie Mellon University, Carnegie Mellon University",1,2,Morning,"Abbreviation expansion is an important problem in clinical natural language processing because abbreviations often occur in text notes in medical records, and expansions of these abbreviations are critical for downstream applications such as assistive diagnosis and insurance code review. Previous studies have treated abbreviation expansion as a special case of word sense disambiguation; however, abbreviation expansion is easier because we only need the character level expansion and not necessarily the full sense of the abbreviation. In particular, such character level expansions may naturally occur elsewhere in medical contexts. Accordingly, we consider two categories of methods for abbreviation expansion: (a) non-sense-based methods that use information solely at lexical levels using state-of-the-art language models, and (b) sense-based methods that also incorporate sense information, such as glosses, from knowledge bases, to simultaneously perform the two tasks of expansion and disambiguation of the abbreviation. We propose two language model based approaches, including a novel length-agnostic permutation language model, find non-sense methods to be more effective than sense-based methods, and achieve the state-of-the-art on three clinical datasets.",11:30am - 12:30pm ET,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1barZpDcvoIIZCjoGnJL4qETwI3kHIeLI

This is especially true for dermatology, a specialty with thousands of skin conditions but many of which have low prevalence in the real world. Motivated by recent advances, we explore few-shot learning methods as well as conventional class imbalance techniques for the skin condition recognition problem and propose an evaluation setup to fairly assess the real-world utility of such approaches. We find the performance of few-show learning methods does not reach that of conventional class imbalance techniques, but combining the two approaches using a novel ensemble improves model performance, especially for rare classes. We conclude that ensembling can be useful to address the class imbalance problem, yet progress can further be accelerated by real-world evaluation setups for benchmarking new methods.","11:30am - 12:30pm ET, 5:15 - 6:15 pm ET",https://drive.google.com/open?id=16HYN4r-oOj74qV4foOKh_HFSZWJGFZHJ

It proves to be of particular practical importance as it combines low-cost portable instrumentation and rapid image acquisition without the risks of ionizing radiation.

Therefore, we propose a novel autoencoder-based framework, DeepHeartBeat, to learn human interpretable representations of cardiac cycles from cardiac ultrasound data. Our model encodes high dimensional observations by a cyclic trajectory in a lower dimensional space. We show that the learned parameters describing the latent trajectory are well interpretable and we prove the versatility of our model by successfully applying it to various cardiologically relevant tasks, such as ejection fraction prediction and arrhythmia detection.

While the application of machine learning to EEG recordings has enabled the successful prediction of whether and when such seizures will occur, the reliable detection of epilepsy during seizure-free periods is lacking.

As far as the authors are aware, this work proposes the first deep learning approach for the latter task -- and the second machine learning approach altogether. Additionally, it does so in an interpretable fashion to validate the proposed method for a more wide-spread adoption in healthcare and to potentially unveil unknown epileptic biomarkers. 
The performance of the Tiny Visual Geometry Group (t-VGG) convolutional neural network is evaluated against Temple University Hospital's EEG Epilepsy Corpus, a data set of variable-length EEG recordings gathered during routine checkups.

However, the effectiveness of self-supervised methods has primarily been demonstrated for natural images. If the results would extrapolate to histopathology images, there could be significant benefits due to the reduced need for annotated data. In this paper, Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC), one of the most promising state-of-the-art self-supervised methods, is extensively evaluated on histology data by varying a range of different parameters, including training objective, resolution, and data setup. From the results, we are able to draw important conclusions on the usefulness of CPC for digital pathology. We show strong evidence of the limitations of the learned representation for tumor classification, where only low-level information learned early during training, in the first CPC layers, is used. Furthermore, in our experiments, diversifying the distribution of the dataset (i.e., data from multiple organs or medical centers) does not lead to the model learning a more general representation. This study deepens the understanding of how the CPC model's objective relates to intrinsic characteristics of histology datasets and will help the development of effective self-supervised methods for histopathology.

Our goal is to prioritize acquiring values for a fixed and known subset of missing confounders in samples that lead to efficient average treatment effect estimation.

Stultz","Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Massachusetts General Hospital ",4,76,Afternoon,"Estimating the effect of a given medical treatment on individual patients involves evaluating how clinical outcomes are affected by the treatment in question. Robust estimates of the treatment effect for a given patient with a pre-specified set of clinical characteristics, are possible to obtain when there is sufficient common support for these features. Essentially, features having the greatest common support correspond to regions of significant overlap between the distributions of the different treatment groups.  In observational datasets, however, all possible treatment options may not be uniformly represented, and therefore robust estimation of their effect may only be possible for the patients in the overlapping region.  In this work, we propose a Contrastive Variational Autoencoder (Contrastive-VAE) to estimate where there is significant overlap between patient distributions corresponding to different treatment options. A Contrastive-VAE exploits shared information between different groups by modeling the shared information as arising from a shared set of latent variables to approximate distributions for treatment options that are not well represented in observational datasets. The result is an improved estimation of the distribution of the groups with a small number of data points. By estimating the likelihood for each group with annealed importance sampling, we are able to quantitatively identify the area of overlap between multiple treatment groups and obtain an effective confidence interval for the estimated individual treatment effect.",5:15 - 6:15 pm ET,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Qrd_fUOGqj908gF-ZvE0oj9svgK1jG4s
Proceedings,576,3D Photography Based Neural Network Craniosynostosis Triaging System,Pouria Mashouri; Marta Skreta; John Phillips; Dianna McAllister; Melissa Roy; Senthujan Senkaiahliyan; Michael Brudno; Devin Singh,Hospital for Sick Children; University Health Network; University of Toronto,4,78,Afternoon,"Craniosynostosis (synostosis) is a serious disease where the sutures of a newborn’s skull fuse prematurely leading to debilitating head shape deformities. Due to the seriousness of this condition many normal infants and those with benign head shape abnormalities are referred to pediatric craniofacial plastic surgeons, leading to a high referral burden and delays in diagnosis for patients. A diagnostic delay beyond 4 months of age excludes patients from being treated with minimally invasive endoscopic procedures, leading to higher risk open surgeries. Machine learning (ML) image classifiers can enhance the triaging process of these referrals through the use of 3D images taken by a multi-camera & angle setup during patient visits. In doing so, children with synostosis can be identified earlier, qualifying them for less invasive endoscopic surgical intervention. After training a variety of convolutional neural network (CNN) models on 3D images supplemented with synthetic images using generative adversarial networks (GANs), the best-performing model was found to be a novel approach developed in our study called a multi-view collapsed 3D CNN, which achieved area under the receiver operating curves (AUROC) between 90.00-97.00% for detecting various sub-types of synostosis. These results demonstrate the ability for ML models to potentially streamline the detection of children with synostosis and help overcome challenges associated with high referral burdens for these patients.
