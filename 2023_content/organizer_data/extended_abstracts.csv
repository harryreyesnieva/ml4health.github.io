These deep, recurrent architectures have displayed increased performance compared to other modeling approaches in a number of tasks, fueling the interest in deploying deep models in clinical settings. One of the key elements in ensuring the safe model deployment and building user trust is model explainability. Testing with Concept Activation Vectors (TCAV) has recently been introduced as a way of providing human-understandable explanations by comparing high-level concepts to the network’s gradients. While the technique has shown promising results in real-world imaging applications, it has not been applied to structured temporal inputs. To enable an application of TCAV to sequential predictions in the EHR, we propose an extension of the method to time series data. We evaluate the proposed approach on an open EHR benchmark from the intensive care unit, as well as synthetic data where we are able to better isolate individual effects.",11:30am - 12:30pm ET,https://drive.google.com/open?id=12iOoccteSy45dutldq18N3lhw5eAZymL

In doing so, we have achieved significant performance benefits of 18-51% (metric dependent) over the commonly used Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, and the Transformer, a multi-head self-attention network.",11:30am - 12:30pm ET,https://drive.google.com/open?id=15V6EMCAzLQ_WqirwjfaJIMy_zUfWV2hA

The model has high accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.94, 95% confidence intervals (CI): [0.90, 0.99]). Proteomic and metabolomic data had the best predictive value, both longitudinally and in early pregnancy (AUC=0.88, 95% CI: [0.81, 0.95]  cross-validated). We validated the prediction model from the urine metabolome (AUC=0.87, 95% CI: [0.76, 0.99]) on an independent cohort of 16 women. Integration with available clinical variables further improved prediction accuracy. These findings were integrated with immune system cytometry data, highlighting known pathology and suggesting novel associations between immune and proteomic dynamics.  While further validation in larger populations is necessary, these encouraging results may serve as a basis for a simple, early predictive test for preeclampsia.

Extended Abstract,83,ParaMed: A Parallel Corpus for English-Chinese Translation in the Biomedical Domain ,"Boxiang Liu, Liang Huang","Baidu Research, Baidu Research; Oregon State University",1,10,Morning,"Biomedical language translation requires multi-lingual language skills as well as relevant domain knowledge. Such requirements make it challenging to train qualified translators and costly to generate high-quality translations. Machine translation represents an effective alternative, but accurate machine translation requires large amounts of in- domain data. While such datasets are abundant in domains such as newswire, they are less accessible in the biomedical domain. Chinese and English are two of the most widely spoken languages, yet to our knowledge, a parallel corpus in the biomedical domain does not exist for this language pair. We develop an effective pipeline to acquire and process an English-Chinese parallel corpus, consisting of about 100,000 sentence pairs and 3,000,000 tokens on each side, from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). We show that training on out-of-domain data and fine-tuning with as few as 4,000 NEJM sentence pairs improve translation quality by 25.3 (13.4) BLEU for en→zh (zh→en) directions. Translation quality continues to improve at a slower pace on larger in-domain data subsets, with an increase of 33.0 (24.3) BLEU for en→zh (zh→en) directions on the full dataset.",11:30am - 12:30pm ET,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DBpZ6uOFBYHTqjZEVcIxHrw3lcWUj4ZT

We show that by integrating
these networks, even a relatively simple epidemiological model can accurately capture real case counts despite dramatic changes over time in population behavior. Our model correctly predicts higher infection rates among disadvantaged socioeconomic and racial groups solely from differences in mobility; we find that disadvantaged groups were not able to reduce mobility as sharply, and the POIs they visit tend to be more crowded and therefore higher risk.","11:30am - 12:30pm ET, 5:15 - 6:15 pm ET",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yZzc6yoc6LNmmu0Ma_nsdO1wMDvO_R5x

One notable case is in improving tuberculosis drug adherence, where a health worker must simultaneously monitor and provide services to many patients. We find that---without considering domain expertise---state of the art algorithms allocate all resources to a small number of patients, neglecting most of the population. To avoid this undesirable behavior, we propose a human-in-the-loop model, where constraints are imposed by domain experts to improve equitability of resource allocations.

We compared score-based classification defined by clinicians to machine learning classification such as SVM-RBF, logistic regression, and XGBoost. We restricted our analyses to data from adults, the population most affected by TB, and investigated the difference between untuned and unweighted classifiers to the cost-sensitive ones. Predictions were compared with the corresponding GeneXpert MTB/Rif results. After adjusting the weight of the positive class to 40 for XGBoost, we achieved 96.64% sensitivity and 35.06% specificity. As such, the sensitivity of our identifier increased by 1.26% while specificity increased by 13.19% in absolute value compared to the traditional score-based method defined by our clinicians. Our approach further demonstrated that only 2000 data points were sufficient to enable the model to converge.

Extended Abstract,151,Learning transition times in event sequences: the Event-Based Hidden Markov Model of disease progression,"Peter A. Wijeratne, Daniel C. Alexander",University College London,1,20,Morning,"Progressive diseases worsen over time and are characterised by monotonic change in features that track disease progression. Here we connect ideas from two formerly separate methodologies -- event-based and hidden Markov modelling -- to derive a new generative model of disease progression. Our model can uniquely infer the most likely group-level sequence and timing of events (natural history) from limited datasets. Moreover, it can infer and predict individual-level trajectories (prognosis) even when data are missing, giving it high clinical utility. Here we derive the model and provide an inference scheme based on the expectation maximisation algorithm. We use clinical, imaging and biofluid data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative to demonstrate the validity and utility of our model. First, we train our model to uncover a new group-level sequence of feature changes in Alzheimer's disease over a period of ∼17.3 years. Next, we demonstrate that our model provides improved utility over a continuous time hidden Markov model by area under the receiver operator characteristic curve ∼0.23. Finally, we demonstrate that our model maintains predictive accuracy with up to 50% missing data.

Existing tools usually make forecasts at the daily or weekly level to assist in planning for staffing requirements. Prompted by new COVID-related capacity constraints placed on our pediatric hospital's emergency department, we developed an hourly forecasting tool to make predictions over a 24 hour window. These forecasts would give our hospital sufficient time to be able to martial resources towards expanding capacity and augmenting staff (e.g. transforming wards or bringing in physicians on call). Using Gaussian Process Regressions (GPRs), we obtain strong performance for both point predictions (average R-squared: 82%) as well as classification accuracy when predicting the ordinal tiers of our hospital's capacity (average precision/recall: 82%/74%). Compared to traditional regression approaches, GPRs not only obtain consistently higher performance, but are also robust to the dataset shifts that have occurred throughout 2020.

Extended Abstract,275,Stable predictions for health related anticausal prediction tasks affected by selection biases: the need to deconfound the test set features,"Elias Chaibub Neto, Phil Snyder, Solveig K Sieberts, Larsson Omberg",Sage Bionetworks,2,30,Morning,"In health related machine learning applications, the training data often corresponds to a non-representative sample from the target populations where the learners will be deployed. In anticausal prediction tasks, selection biases often make the associations between confounders and the outcome variable unstable across different target environments. As a consequence, the predictions from confounded learners are often unstable, and might fail to generalize in shifted test environments. Stable prediction approaches aim to solve this problem by producing predictions that are stable across unknown test environments. These approaches, however, are sometimes applied to the training data alone with the hope that training an unconfounded model will be enough to generate stable predictions in shifted test sets. Here, we show that this is insufficient, and that improved stability can be achieved by deconfounding the test set features as well.

The state of the art therefore relies on strongly-supervised model training using additional local annotations from domain experts. However, in the absence of detailed annotations, most weakly-supervised approaches depend on a frozen feature extractor pre-trained on ImageNet. We identify this as a key weakness and propose to train an in-domain feature extractor on histology images using MoCo v2, a recent self-supervised learning algorithm. Experimental results on Camelyon16 and TCGA show that the proposed extractor greatly outperforms its ImageNet counterpart. In particular, our results improve the weakly-supervised state of the art on Camelyon16 from 91.4% to 98.7% AUC, thereby closing the gap with strongly-supervised models that reach 99.3% AUC. Through these experiments, we demonstrate that feature extractors trained via self-supervised learning can act as drop-in replacements to significantly improve existing machine learning techniques in histology.

Extended Abstract,362,Recommendations for Bayesian hierarchical model specifications for case-control studies in mental health,"Vincent Valton, Toby Wise, Oliver J. Robinson","Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London; Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry, University College London; Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London",2,35,Morning,"Hierarchical model fitting has become commonplace for case-control studies of cognition and behaviour in mental health. However, these techniques require us to formalise assumptions about the data-generating process at the group level, which may not be known. Specifically, researchers typically must choose whether to assume all subjects are drawn from a common population, or to model them as deriving from separate populations. These assumptions have profound implications for computational psychiatry, as they affect the resulting inference (latent parameter recovery) and may conflate or mask true group-level differences. 

To test these assumptions we ran systematic simulations on synthetic multi-group behavioural data from a commonly used multi-armed bandit task (reinforcement learning task). We then examined recovery of group differences in latent parameter space under the two commonly used generative modelling assumptions: (1) modelling groups under a common shared group-level prior (assuming all participants are generated from a common distribution, and are likely to share common characteristics); (2) modelling separate groups based on symptomatology or diagnostic labels, resulting in separate group-level priors. 

We evaluated the robustness of these approaches to variations in data quality and prior specifications on a variety of metrics. We found that fitting groups separately (assumptions 2), provided the most accurate and robust inference across all conditions. Our results suggest that when dealing with data from multiple clinical groups, researchers should analyse patient and control groups separately as it provides the most accurate and robust recovery of the parameters of interest.",11:30am - 12:30pm ET,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oOk3IuSfBo4CmhEY9ONhRmBdAoJ5FSnd

The diversity of symptoms and immune pathways expressed in SLE patients causes difficulties in treating SLE as well as in new clinical trials. This study used unsupervised learning on gene expression data from adult SLE patients to separate patients into clusters. The dimensionality of the gene expression data was reduced by three separate methods (PCA, UMAP, and a simple linear autoencoder) and the results from each of these methods were used to separate patients into six clusters with k-means clustering. The clusters revealed three separate immune pathways in the SLE patients that caused SLE. These pathways were: (1) high interferon levels, (2) high autoantibody levels, and (3) dysregulation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. The first two pathways have been extensively studied in SLE. However, mitochondrial apoptosis has not been investigated before to the best of our knowledge as a standalone cause of SLE, independent of autoantibody production, indicating that mitochondrial proteins could lead to a new set of therapeutic targets for SLE in future research.",11:30am - 12:30pm ET,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1B-4-I4axFdHpHZgrpEBaAeDlADpK2wGd

Compared to an end-to-end approach that generates the full SOAP note from the full conversation, our approach improves by 8 ROUGE-1 points.","11:30am - 12:30pm ET, 5:15 - 6:15 pm ET",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EltGjcai49rqZyFfUC8_Nld6hBgWaz1x

Each asthma patient reacts very differently to potential triggers. Hence, there is a need to develop a personalized framework for each patient to capture susceptibility to asthma triggers. We developed a personalized knowledge-based probabilistic model to predict asthma exacerbation for different environmental factors utilizing patient generated health data from pediatric asthma patients. Further, the personalized model provides a metric, called Health Coefficient, to quantify the health of a patient for varying environmental factors.We demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the developed stochastic model and discuss its viability in managing asthma symptoms and opportunity for early clinical intervention.","11:30am - 12:30pm ET, 5:15 - 6:15 pm ET",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1S56FYHK_WV1xVVPStAc2qT_Ug5193uU8

However, improved NLP model performance is reliant on robust data sources in both clinical and non-clinical settings. Recent work has shown that non-clinical NLP datasets contain substantial overlap between their training and test sets, leading to inflated reported performances. In this work, we analyze three benchmark clinical NLP datasets for natural language inference and entity recognition/normalization. We find significant train-test overlap in each dataset that is larger than similar general-domain datasets. For example, in the MedNLI dataset, 37\% of test set hypotheses appear in the training data, and we show that models perform dramatically worse in the absence of this overlap. Our findings demonstrate the importance of accounting for such train-test overlaps. ","11:30am - 12:30pm ET, 5:15 - 6:15 pm ET",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1M-YpxxRV9108kacraz3PQT3DWHXd_PHk
Extended Abstract,484,A stability-driven protocol for drug response interpretable prediction (staDRIP),"Xiao Li*, Tiffany M. Tang*, Xuewei Wang, Jean-Pierre A. Kocher, Bin Yu","UC Berkeley, UC Berkeley, Mayo Clinic, Mayo Clinic, UC Berkeley",4,75,Afternoon,"Modern cancer -omics and pharmacological data hold great promise in precision cancer medicine for developing individualized patient treatments. However, high heterogeneity and noise in such data pose challenges for predicting the response of cancer cell lines to therapeutic drugs accurately. As a result, arbitrary human judgment calls are rampant throughout the predictive modeling pipeline. In this work, we develop a transparent stability-driven pipeline for drug response interpretable predictions, or staDRIP, which builds upon the PCS framework for veridical data science (Yu and Kumbier, 2020) and mitigates the impact of human judgment calls.  Here we use the PCS framework for the first time in cancer research to extract proteins and genes that are important in predicting the drug responses and stable across appropriate data and model perturbations. Out of the 24 most stable proteins we identified using data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), 18 have been associated with the drug response or identified as a known or possible drug target in previous literature, demonstrating the utility of our stability-driven pipeline for knowledge discovery in cancer drug response prediction modeling.","11:30am - 12:30pm ET, 5:15 - 6:15 pm ET",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FK19mchEGBbAJFThUna9gZ2xUB4-lU7q

However, many checklists are constructed based on heuristics, and not learnt from real-world data. In this work, we present a method to learn optimal checklists from data. We model checklists as binary classifiers, and formulate checklist creation as an integer linear program. Our method allows practitioners to easily add operational constraints on performance and feature selection. We validate our method by learning checklists to predict in-hospital mortality from MIMIC-III. Our results show that our approach can fit simple customized checklists that perform well under a variety of constraints.","11:30am - 12:30pm ET, 5:15 - 6:15 pm ET",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1duYfCTzzOfT5XvqIhCU8eecH4zZP9VbU

Understanding the build-up of such ideation is critical for the identification of at-risk users and suicide prevention. Suicide ideation is often linked to a history of mental depression. In this work, we focus on identifying suicidal intent in English tweets by augmenting linguistic models with historical emotional context. We propose STATENet, a time-aware transformer based model for preliminary screening of suicidal risk on social media. STATENet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the utility of emotional and temporal contextual cues for suicide risk assessment.","11:30am - 12:30pm ET, 5:15 - 6:15 pm ET",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qfW-CYjmYoVa7IUBXPVsNxRFAI-5OIHQ

Symptom checkers are a common approach to provide an online assessment, but the use of rule-based systems introduces important limitations. This leads to COVID-19 symptom checkers not being able to provide a differential diagnosis. In this paper we present an approach that combines the strengths of traditional AI expert systems with novel deep learning models to leverage prior knowledge as well as any amount of existing data. We combine synthetic data generated from an expert system with real-world data coming from an online COVID-19 symptom checker to train a COVID-19 aware differential diagnosis deep learning model and show that our approach is able to accurately model new incoming data about COVID-19 while still preserving accuracy on other diagnosis.

In this work, we propose an uncertainty-aware boosting technique for multi-modal ensembling to predict Alzheimer’s Dementia Severity. The propagation of uncertainty across acoustic, cognitive, and linguistic features produces an ensemble system robust to heteroscedasticity in the data.
